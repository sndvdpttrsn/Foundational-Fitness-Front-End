                Foundational Fitness is a fictional website with real life implications dedicated 
                to helping the user learn about Fitness. <br/>
                The concepts explained are very basic and foundational exercises. <br/>
                If you follow the fitness program and understand how the exercises are executed and beneficial, <br/>
                then you will get healthier with respect to physical fitness. <br/>
                The reason why foundational fitness is so important is because computer programmers typically <br/>
                live a sedentary lifestyle and foundational fitness seeks to minimize that.

                <p>
                    You've heard that stretching is important. However, static stretching should be <br/>
                    saved for the end of a workout, not the beginning. When warming up, it is important <br/>
                    to move the parts of the body that you will be exercising. Follow the following dynamic <br/>
                    stretches in order to warm up your body before exerting yourself for your respective exercise. <br/>
                    A typical dynamic warmup lasts about fifteen minutes.

                <p>
                    You've heard that stretching is important. However, static stretching should be <br/>
                    saved for the end of a workout, not the beginning. Even further, it is important <br/>
                    to walk around a bit before beginning your static stretches. Follow the following static <br/>
                    stretches in order to cool down your body after exerting yourself during your respective exercise. <br/>
                    A typical static stretch session lasts about fifteen minutes.
